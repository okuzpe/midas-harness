## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-16

**Build-phase 1:** greenfield foundation. Establishes the harness floor that all future phases extend.

### Added

#### Harness core
- `harness/methodology.md` — 9-phase lifecycle overview with state-machine diagram and brownfield entry notes.
- `harness/conventions.md` — always-on base conventions (code quality, naming, errors, testing, deps, git, security, design system); single body inlined into generated adapters.
- `harness/state.schema.md` — schema reference for `harness/state.yaml`, the single source of truth for phase progress.
- `harness/rules/context7-usage.md` — mandatory rule: fetch live library docs via Context7 before writing any third-party code; web fallback documented.
- `harness/pipeline/00-idea-intake.md` through `harness/pipeline/08-audit-adjust.md` — per-phase playbooks covering actor, inputs, steps, exit gate, and artifacts for each of the 9 phases.

#### Agent Skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- `/keel-init` — interactive installer; writes `harness/state.yaml` and generates adapters; guarded ritual.
- `/keel-status` — reads state and prints the single next action; scout-tier, read-only.
- `/keel-doctor` — detects adapter drift and re-renders `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/00-keel.mdc`, `.windsurf/rules/00-keel.md` from source; guarded ritual.
- `/idea-intake` — Phase 0 skill; captures raw idea, 1-line pitch, and mode into `product/idea.md` + `harness/state.yaml`.
- `/contextualize` — Phase 1 skill; gap-audit loop, resolves BLOCKING open questions, writes `product/open-questions.md`.
- `/choose-architecture` — Phase 4 skill; Context7-verified stack selection, writes `product/architecture.md` and first ADR.
- `/define-conventions` — Phase 5 skill; generates stack-specific rules + design-system scaffolding; guarded ritual.
- `/plan-sprints` — Phase 6 skill; writes `product/roadmap.md` and `product/sprints/NN-*.md`.
- `/start-sprint` — Phase 7 skill; activates a sprint, gates on gate: passed; guarded ritual.
- `/close-sprint` — Phase 7→8 handoff; triggers audit; guarded ritual.

#### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)
- `keel-orchestrator` (`claude-opus-4-8`) — think/plan/audit; used for ~6 irreversible phase decisions.
- `keel-builder` (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) — implement/write artifacts; default execution model.
- `keel-scout` (`claude-haiku-4-5`) — search/extract/status; cheapest tier for mechanical tasks.

#### Tool adapters (generated; do not hand-edit)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code project law, inlined from `AGENTS.md` + `harness/conventions.md`.
- `.cursor/rules/00-keel.mdc` — Cursor adapter.
- `.windsurf/rules/00-keel.md` — Windsurf adapter.

#### MCP wiring
- `.mcp.json` — secret-free config wiring Context7 (HTTP) and sequential-thinking (npx); `${ENV_VAR}` pattern documented for optional servers.

#### Scripts
- `scripts/render-adapters.mjs` — re-renders all three tool adapters from source; no external deps.
- `scripts/doctor.mjs` — detects adapter drift, reports mismatches, optionally re-renders; called by `/keel-doctor`.

#### Docs & governance
- `AGENTS.md` — project law for all AI agents; source of truth for generated adapters.
- `README.md` — quickstart, phase overview, supported-tools matrix, MCP section, status.
- `docs/agents-and-models.md` — single bump point for model IDs and cost profiles.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSIONING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` — governance floor.
- `LICENSE` — Apache-2.0.
- `.gitignore` — ignores caches, hashes, and volatile state; commits `harness/state.yaml`.

#### Example
- `examples/taskpilot/` — fully-populated greenfield product showing every phase artifact (idea, open questions, market, business plan, architecture, ADR, rules, design system, roadmap, sprint, audit) and a runnable code slice.

### Known limitations (v0.1)
- Brownfield entry at Phase 4/5 prints a safe manual path; full dry-run + diff-confirm support is deferred.
- Market-research (`/market-research`) and business-case (`/business-case`) skills are scaffolded but not yet interactive; they delegate to `/deep-research` with manual prompting.
- Cursor and Windsurf adapters do not yet auto-reload on `/keel-doctor`; re-open the editor after re-rendering.
- Plugin marketplace is not yet implemented; enrichment agents are consumed ad-hoc if present.
